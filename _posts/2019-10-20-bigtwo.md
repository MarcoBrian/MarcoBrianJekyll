# A Java Card Game 
[Link to the Github repository](https://github.com/MarcoBrian/GOT-CardGame)

## Introduction
This card game is an implementation of using object oriented programming (OOP) in applications. The game is written in the Java programming language and created just by using its standard library, especially the graphics library for the implementation of the GUI. The game is based on the famous card game called [Big Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two), this is quite a popular card game in Asia even in my country, Indonesia. Watch how to play the game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PouhpfTuYic) . 

I implemented the game with a Game Of Thrones theme, during that time of writing I was super hyped for GOT’s season 8 finale (but we all know how that turned out… :disappointed: )


During the development of the game there were multiple stages of development, starting with just writing out the logic of the game and running the game out of the console. Afterwards, the GUI is developed and a lot of event handling was created for the game to work. Finally the final version includes multiple player feature where each player has an instance of the game and the players can chat with each other through a chatroom. 


## Running the game

** Step 1 ** &nbsp;Running `BigTwoServer.java`
Before we can play the game this is the program that should be run. This will start the server program so that the clients of the game could run. 

Once the server has run successfully there will be a pop up which looks something like this

**Step 2** Running `BigTwoClient.java`

Running this will prompt for a player name and add the player to the game

Once the player is added there will be an image of your player popping up, but the game will not start yet because you will have to add more players to the game

Keep adding more players, there should be 4 players so that the game can start
If you add more players when the game is full then the player will not be able to join the game. Once all 4 players have joined then you can enjoy and play the game, the first one to finish the card is the winner.

If you try to add more than 4 players then the game will not allow that player to join because the game is full.

###Chatroom feature
This is just a fun extension so that players can communicate between each other. Try typing something on the chatroom.
